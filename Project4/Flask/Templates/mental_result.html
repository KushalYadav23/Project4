            <h3> 1. Get regular exercise</h3>
                <p><img id = "preimage" src = "/static/image/physical_exercise.jpg" alt = "Pysical Execise" width = 190 height = "190">
                    Just 30 minutes of walking every day can help boost your mood and improve your health. Small amounts of exercise add up, so don’t be discouraged if you can’t do 30 minutes at one time.
                </p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                <h3 > 2. Eat healthy, regular meals and stay hydrated</h3>
                <p><img id = "preimage" src = "/static/image/Food.jpg" alt = "Food" width = 190 height = "190">
                    A balanced diet and plenty of water can improve your energy and focus throughout the day. Also, limit caffeinated beverages such as soft drinks or coffee.
                </p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                <h3 > 3. Make sleep a priority</h3>
                <p><img id = "preimage" src = "/static/image/sleep.jpg" alt = "Food" width = 190 height = "190">
                    Stick to a schedule, and make sure you’re getting enough sleep. Blue light from devices and screens can make it harder to fall asleep, so reduce blue light exposure from your phone or computer before bedtime.
                </p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                <h3 > 4. Try a relaxing activity</h3>
                <p><img id = "preimage" src = "/static/image/relaxing.jpg" alt = "Food" width = 190 height = "190">
                    Explore relaxation or wellness programs or apps, which may incorporate meditation, muscle relaxation, or breathing exercises. Schedule regular times for these and other healthy activities you enjoy such as journaling.
                </p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                <h3 > 5. Set goals and priorities</h3>

                    Explore relaxation or wellness programs or apps, which may incorporate meditation, muscle relaxation, or breathing exercises. Schedule regular times for these and other healthy activities you enjoy such as journaling.
                </p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                <h3 > 6. Practice gratitude</h3>
                <p><img id = "preimage" src = "/static/image/gratitude.jpg" alt = "Food" width = 190 height = "190">
                    Remind yourself daily of things you are grateful for. Be specific. Write them down at night, or replay them in your mind.
                </p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                <h3 > 7. Focus on positivity</h3>
                <p><img id = "preimage" src = "/static/image/positive.jpg" alt = "Food" width = 190 height = "190">
                    Identify and challenge your negative and unhelpful thoughts.
